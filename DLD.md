### Notes:
- Focus on **high-level optimization** for performance tuning in ALUs, digital systems, and asynchronous designs.
- Keep **race condition and fault tolerance** principles sharp, as they're critical for handling edge cases in design and for real-world circuit behavior.
- Use **mock tests** to gauge your exam readiness and time management.

### Final Recommendations:
- **Focus on Speed:** Improve the ability to solve problems in less time with increasing complexity.
- **Error Tracking:** Continue focusing on mistakes and weaknesses throughout each section.
- **GATE Strategy:** Apply the learned concepts directly to GATE-style questions to ensure the final exam prep is smooth.
