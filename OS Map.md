### Exam Day: Final Strategy

1. **Pre-exam Preparation**
   - Sleep well the night before.
   - Review your flashcards and key formulas one last time in the morning.
   - Ensure you have all required materials (admit card, ID, pen, etc.).

2. **During the Exam**
   - **Time Management**: Stick to the time limits for each question. Don’t linger too long on any one problem.
   - **Start with Easier Questions**: Work through problems you're confident with first to build momentum.
   - **Systematic Approach**: If you get stuck, move on and return later with a fresh mind. Use elimination techniques for multiple-choice questions.
   - **Optimize Calculations**: For problems requiring heavy calculations, break them into smaller parts to avoid errors.
   - **Double-check Key Answers**: For longer or more complex answers, ensure your solution is complete.

3. **After the Exam**
   - **Post-Exam Reflection**: Do not overanalyze your mistakes. Focus on the bigger picture: the process, not the result.
   - **Rest and Recharge**: It’s a grueling journey. Celebrate the effort you've put in. Take some time to relax and recharge before your next step.
